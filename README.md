# [Ijeoma Odoko - Data Analyst/Engineer Portfolio](https://ijeomaodoko.github.io/)

This Github Portfolio Page was created using a Bootstrap Theme by Start Boostrap LLC under the MIT License (MIT).

Below are the key steps I took to create my GitHub page using the Bootstrap theme: 

### 1. [Preview the Bootstrap theme](https://startbootstrap.com/themes/stylish-portfolio/).

### 2. [Go to the StartBootstrap Github Page for Stylish Portfolio](https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-stylish-portfolio). Click on *Use this Template*.
  
### 3. Create a new repository, name should match your *github user name*.github.io. 

### 4. Place any images you want to use to personalize the site in the *img* folder. 

### 5. Edit the *CSS* and *HTML* files to personalize the site. 

Tips: CSS and HTML is not my area of expertise, so I relied heavily on this [Online HTML Editor](https://html-online.com/editor/) and [HTML Cheat Sheet](https://htmlcheatsheet.com/) to help put the page together.
